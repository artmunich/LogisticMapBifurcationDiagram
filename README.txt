Logistic Map Bifurcation Diagram

This is a repository of tools for creating pretty images of the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map. Mildly inspired by the wikipedia image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Logistic_Bifurcation_map_High_Resolution.png

The tools will allow creating images zoomed in to any location of the diagram (computational limits apply). A sample image of the diagram at the same zoom as the wikipedia image is provided.
